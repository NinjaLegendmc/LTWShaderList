# LTW Shader List for PojavLauncher
## What Is PojavLauncher?
Search it yourself.
## What Is LTW?
LTW is one of a render engine to run PojavLauncher.
## Why This List Were Created?
Well, since shaders weren't mostly compatible with LTW, this list is created to list every shaders that compatible with LTW render.
## Why Use LTW Instead Of Other Render Engine?
This Render Is Only One Well Optimized. Zink does support alot of shaders but it's really unoptimized. Not like LTW, which still have bugs and unimplemented render features.
## iris compatibility with mali gpus and old adreno gpus & blank, invisible world
please note that iris uses:
 GL_ARB_shader_texture_lod on Desktop OpenGL or GL_EXT_shader_texture_lod on OpenGL ES/LTW and if your
 mali gpu or old Adreno gpu doesn't have this extension support it will result blank or invisible world
 when use shaders, you can try optifine instead of iris but note that it is still
 not guaranteed that the shaders will work on optifine as well as optifine also required some
 some extension like that, hope so you understand

## Note
This list also lists shader that has bugs, but not critical bugs.

Since The List Maintainer is only myself. The shaders on list may have undiscovered bugs due to differences of GPUs.
